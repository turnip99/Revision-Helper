# Revision-Helper
C# Revision Application.

## Instructions for getting started:

1. Download the file 'RevisionApp'.

2. Find the file in windows explorer.

3. Right click on the downloaded file --> 7-Zip --> 'Extract to "RevisionApp/". If this option does not appear, either download 7Zip or use WinRAR.

4. Open the new folder 'RevisionApp'. You can delete the ZIP file if you like.

5. You should have 4 files in this folder:

-Readme.txt - this contains the information that you're reading right now.

-AccessDatabaseEngine.exe - this installs software that allows the program to run. It should probably already be installed, so you can most likely completely ignore this one.

-RevisionDatabase.accdb - this is the underlying database. Don't mess with this unless you really have to.

-Revision Helper.exe - this is the main file, and (hopefully) the only one you will need to worry about. This file and the database must be stored in the same location, though. You cannot move one without the other and still expect the program to run as intended.

Open up the 'Revision Helper.exe' file.

6. Upon reaching the menu, hit 'information' or 'test'.

7. There are two possible issues that could occur here.

-If the problem has some sort of error, then crashes, install 'AccessDatabaseEngine.exe' then try again.

-If the entire interface does not appear to fit on the screen (if there are bits which are obviously off the screen), then close the page and select one of the lower resolutions on the main menu (1366x768 or 1600x900). Bear in mind that you will have to tick your desired resolution each time you start the app up.

8. Once these things are sorted, you're good to go!

## The four pages on the main menu are:

- Add Subject - Basically allows you to add a new subject to the database, in case you wanted to use the app for other lessons.

- Add Topic - Allows you to input a new topic to the database. You will need to input a title, subject, image, two blocks of next and up to four multiple choice questions.

- Information - Here, you can go through the list on the left to view the text and images related to each topic. You can edit/delete topics, too.

- Test - You can see on the left the list of topics; you may tick the topics that you wish to test yourself on, select the test length, then hit 'Begin Test'. The tests will randomise the questions, and you must select the correct answer for each one - it is timed. This is particularly good when utilising a touch-screen. When the game is over, your scores will be saved to the database, and you will be able to view your overall records and topic-specific records. The topics on the left will be coloured depending on how well you fare at them - allowing you to measure which topics still require revision!

And... that's all - happy revising!
